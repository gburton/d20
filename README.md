I got tired of writing my stats down, so I started recording on a spreadsheet.
I soon got tired of that, so this script was born.

## Terminology

- Session = 21 Rounds
- Round = 15 darts at one double
- Hit = successful dart at the aimed for double

## How it works

- The script chooses a random Double.
- You throw 15 darts and keep track of how many Hit.
- Insert that number (would be 0 - 15) after the Round is up.
- A new random Double is chosen
- Repeat...for all 21 doubles (D25 included)

At the end of the Session, your data is available on the Report Page.

## Report Page
